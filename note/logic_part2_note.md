#第二阶段总结

create by 邹峰 2018/3/22

----
##三大从句：
### 1.定语从句###
> 定语从句本质是合并同类项，分类后其实就两种


- 人 **who**
- 物 **which**
- 偷懒行为 **That** ：`有强调和停顿的意思`

	其他地点，时间本质是which的延伸
	where --> in which
	when --> on which
	why --> which
	whose --> who
	whom --> who

限定，非限定？

什么时候用必须用that：


	
### 2.状语从句

> 状语本质是独立结构
> 
•  时间状语 when while 地点状语where
•  原因状语 because , for ,as , due to
•  目的状语 inorder, so that
•  条件状语if, unless, as/so long as , lest ,in case
•  结果状语 so , so that
•  让步状语 as if , although, though
•  方式状语by way of , by means of
•  比较状语 than as as, not as as, no sooner than


 **原句**：When i was a boy, i fell in love with W.
 **简化**：`Being` a boy,i fell in love with W.

**原句**：As he was elected as the new president, he became prudent
 **简化**：`Elected` as the new president, he became prudent

**原句**： Because he has finished his home work, he is allowed to play video games
 **简化**：`Having` finished his home work, he is allowed to play video games
 
	简化原则：
	状语本身可省略（when,where,why and so on）
	状语的主语和句子的主语一致时，主语可省略
	谓语是“是”（be,is,are）的意思，且后面跟着名词是，谓语“是”可以省略

> **例句** ： _  **D** _, we’d like to go outing.
>  A. If Sunday is OK B. Sunday being OK C. Sunday OK D. A,B and C
 
### 3.名称性从句
名词性从句没啥意思 主语从句，宾语从句，同谓语从句

	有趣点：反问句
	She is pretty, isn’t she?
	I never thought that he would come for the dinner party, could he?


## 倒装与强调
> 倒装的本质就是为了强调
## 动词与介词

## 名称的可数性/主谓一致性

### 练习
>  **例句**：You have all heard that men of science work by means of induction and deduction，that by the help of these operations，they，in a sort of sense，manage to extract from Nature certain natural laws ，and that out of these laws，by some special skill of their own，they build up their theories about the running of our world

**分析思路**：
1. 长句先找并列词，划分句子结构
    例句是个宾语从句的分裂，本质是三个句子
    You have all heard that（句子1）that（句子2）, and that（句子3）
2. 从句和插入语分析，从句中找到主干，先忽略插入语
   You have all heard that `men of science work by means of induction and deduction`，that `by the help of these operations manage to extract from Nature certain natural laws` ，and that `out of these laws they build up their theories about the running of our world`
>  **译文**：你都听过这些：科研人员通过归纳和演绎的方式工作，（他们在某种意义上）通过这些方式从自然届中提取自然法则，然后（通过他们拥有的特殊技能）用这些帮助他们建立我们的世界运行的理论。

> **例句**：That experiences influence subsequent behavior is the evidence of an obvious but nevertheless remarkable activity called remembering.

**分析思路**：
1.that 开头可分析这个是个主语从句，划分主谓宾为
（That `experiences influence subsequent behavior`（主） is `the evidence of an obvious but nevertheless remarkable activity`（宾） ）（主） called （谓）remembering（宾）.
>  **译文**：经验影响后续行为是明显的证据但是不引人注目的活动，被称为回忆
